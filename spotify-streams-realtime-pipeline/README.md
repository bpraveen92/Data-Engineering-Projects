# Spotify Streams: Real-Time Analytics Pipeline (Kinesis and Spark)

A continuation of the Spotify Streams batch pipeline using the same music streaming dataset, redesigned for stream-based processing. A PySpark Structured Streaming job reads live music events from Kinesis, joins them with song/user metadata, and writes 5-minute windowed aggregations to S3 as Parquet. Runs entirely in Docker locally using LocalStack and MinIO — no AWS account needed to test.

**Stack**: PySpark 3.5 · Kinesis · Parquet on S3  
**Local testing**: Docker (Spark + LocalStack + MinIO)  
**Production**: AWS Glue Streaming (primary) · EMR Serverless (alternative, pending [Issue #79](https://github.com/awslabs/spark-sql-kinesis-connector/issues/79))

## What It Does

Reads `{user_id, track_id, timestamp, event_type}` events from Kinesis, enriches them with broadcast-joined dimension tables, and produces three 5-minute windowed aggregations:

| Output Table | Contents |
|---|---|
| `hourly_streams/` | Stream counts per track and country |
| `top_tracks_hourly/` | Tracks ranked by play count |
| `country_metrics_hourly/` | Unique users and tracks per country |

Results land as partitioned Parquet in MinIO (local) or S3 (production), queryable via Athena.

## Architecture

            S3 / MinIO — Parquet, partitioned by window_start
```

One script, two deployment modes — only `--trigger-mode` changes:

| Deployment | Mode | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| AWS Glue Streaming | `continuous` — always-on, sub-minute latency | ~$21/day |
| EMR Serverless | `available_now` — drain & exit every 30 min | ~$0.50–1/day (blocked — see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md G5](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)) |

## Running Locally

### One-time setup (fresh clone)

The Kinesis connector JAR is not committed to git. Build it once:

```bash
make build-kinesis-jar   # ~3 min, requires Docker
```

Also download the two S3A support JARs into `jars/`:

```bash
curl -L -o jars/hadoop-aws-3.3.4.jar \
  https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-aws/3.3.4/hadoop-aws-3.3.4.jar

curl -L -o jars/aws-java-sdk-bundle-1.12.565.jar \
  https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/amazonaws/aws-java-sdk-bundle/1.12.565/aws-java-sdk-bundle-1.12.565.jar
```

All three JARs must exist before running `make up` — they're baked into the Docker image.

### Step 1 — Start containers

```bash
make up
docker compose ps   # wait for all 3 to show healthy
```

| Container | Role | Port |
|---|---|---|
| `etl-project-2-spark` | runs the PySpark job | 4040 (Spark UI) |
| `etl-project-2-localstack` | mocks Kinesis | 4566 |
| `etl-project-2-minio` | mocks S3 | 9000 (API), 9001 (console) |

### Step 2 — Create the MinIO bucket

Open **http://localhost:9001** (minioadmin / minioadmin), create bucket **`etl-project-2-data`**, and upload `songs.csv` and `users.csv` into the bucket root. Do this after every `make up` — `make down` wipes the volume.

### Step 3 — Run the producer

```bash
make producer
```

Sends 20 synthetic events every 5 seconds to `music-streams` on LocalStack. The stream is auto-created on first run.

### Step 4 — Run the aggregator

In a second terminal:

```bash
make consumer
```

Reads from Kinesis, joins with dimension tables, writes Parquet to `s3a://etl-project-2-data/aggregations/`. First Parquet output appears after ~5 minutes (one window closes).

> **TRIM_HORIZON:** The consumer always reads from the start of the shard. If the producer ran first, Spark replays the backlog before catching up — no events are lost. Event-time windowing ensures backlogged records land in their correct original windows.

### Step 5 — Browse results

**http://localhost:9001** → `etl-project-2-data` → `aggregations/` — three folders partitioned by `window_start`.

Spark UI at **http://localhost:4040** → Structured Streaming shows all 3 active queries.

### Step 6 — Tear down

```bash
make down
```

## Design Choices

**Broadcast joins** — songs and users are small static tables; broadcasting them avoids any shuffle on the streaming side.

**`foreachBatch` + `coalesce`** — intercepts each micro-batch to consolidate output into one file per window partition instead of hundreds of small fragments.

**`--local` flag** — switches endpoints from LocalStack/MinIO to real AWS. Same script, no code changes between environments.

**`outputMode("append")`** — each closed window is written exactly once. Correct for event-time windowed aggregations.

make up                  # start containers

make aws-producer        # run producer against real AWS Kinesis
make glue-start          # start Glue Streaming job
make glue-status         # check latest Glue run
make emr-start           # submit EMR Serverless job (set EMR_APP_ID + EMR_EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN)
